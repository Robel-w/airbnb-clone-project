# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Project

> *A full-stack, enterprise-level simulation of a modern property booking platform.*

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is an immersive, full-scale web development initiative inspired by real-world booking platforms like Airbnb. This project is designed to sharpen your backend architecture, database modeling, team collaboration, and DevOps practices by emulating the complexities of scalable production systems.

By building this clone, learners gain critical insights into designing robust APIs, integrating security protocols, and deploying services using modern CI/CD methodologies. The project not only focuses on code but also reinforces the importance of effective documentation, planning, and collaborative software development lifecycle practices.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Develop a scalable, secure, and modular **Airbnb-like platform**.
- Master **collaborative team workflows** using GitHub and Agile principles.
- Architect and model **relational databases** mirroring real-world entities.
- Build and secure RESTful and GraphQL **APIs**.
- Design and integrate **CI/CD pipelines** for seamless deployment.
- Utilize **Docker** and container-based environments for development and testing.
- Gain exposure to **end-to-end project lifecycle management**.

## 🧩 Database Design (ERD Overview)

Entities: `User`, `Listing`, `Booking`, `Review`, `Message`, `Payment`  
Attributes: Proper normalization, referential integrity, and scalable indexing  
Relationships: One-to-many (User → Listing), many-to-many (User ↔ Booking), etc.

*A full ERD diagram will be included in `/docs/`.*
